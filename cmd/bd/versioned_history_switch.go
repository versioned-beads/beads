// The resolver for the versioned-history switch -- which planes it reads, why they
// are OR'd, how a store that cannot answer is handled -- lives in
// internal/versionedhistory, so that bd doctor's fix package (which cannot import
// package main) applies the same rule. This file keeps the two names the rest of
// cmd/bd uses.

// versionedHistorySettingKey is the one spelling of the switch, used for both the
// store-config read and the `bd config set` line the help text and the off-refusal
// tell people to run. They must not drift, so it is defined once, in the package
// that reads it.
const versionedHistorySettingKey = versionedhistory.ConfigKey

// versionedHistoryEnabled reports whether THIS STORE is recording versions: its
// own settings row, and nothing else. It is what `bd versions` calls, where the
// read is the point and no capability gate precedes it.
//
// It deliberately does not fold in the environment or config.yaml the way the
// rule for writers does. Those are process-wide and can only turn recording on
// for the writes this process makes; `bd versions` only reads, so they cannot
// make the store record anything. Letting them answer here made a store that
// never recorded read as one that was, and "No versions recorded yet" is the
// empty answer this command's three outcomes exist to prevent. What other
// clients of the store will do is what the store's row says.
func versionedHistoryEnabled(ctx context.Context, st storage.DoltStorage) bool {
	return versionedhistory.StoreSetting(ctx, st)

// versionedHistoryRefusalListLimit is how many offending issues the refusal spells
// out. The count it leads with is always the whole number.
const versionedHistoryRefusalListLimit = 20

// checkVersionedHistoryCanBeEnabled is the check `bd config set
// versioned-history.enabled true` and `bd config set-many
// versioned-history.enabled=true` make before they write the setting, and it
// makes it for that value alone: any other key, and every value that does not
// turn recording on (`false` included), passes without reading a row.
//
// With history on, recording a version runs in the same transaction as the write,
// so a write that introduces a number outside the I-JSON exact-integer range, or
// a duplicate key, already fails atomically. A row that holds one BEFORE the
// switch is turned on -- written while history was off, or by a path that does not
// record -- would fail every later write to it. So the switch reads every issue
// the store would version, runs the very function recording runs over each one's
// metadata (issueops.FindUnversionableMetadata), and refuses, writing nothing,
// while any is refused.
//
// It reads through the same role accessor `bd list` does, so the direct and the
// proxied route both answer, and with the request that means "everything": every
// status, pinned rows, every type, and both planes (the scan itself skips the rows
// recording never versions). Limit 0 with no MaxRows is an unbounded read: a store
// larger than a page must not be checked on a page. A read that fails refuses the
// switch too, because a check that could not run has not passed.
//
// On the direct route it reads through the store the command has already opened:
// `config set` opens it through openWorkspaceConfig before it asks, and the
// command's pre-run has opened it for a `config set-many` that names a database
// key, before the batch is validated. The proxied route reads through its provider.
//
// The environment and config.yaml planes do not pass through these commands, so
// they are not checked here; for those, recording's own refusal at write time is
// the control.
