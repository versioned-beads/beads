// This file implements R7.1 as-of read (gastownhall/beads#5898 revision 9,
// gastownhall/beads#6136, this slice: be-x5jqd.5 / backend/conformance/
// versioned_read_contract.go): given an instant T or a version address, it
// returns one issue's durable state as of that point -- the latest version
// accepted at or before T, with everything later excluded -- marking the
// address it served, or refuses as gone or unknown with the reason (R8,
// R20). It reads issue_versions rows minted by RecordVersionInTx /
// RecordVersionAtInTx (version_history.go); it adds no writer of its own for
// the mutation path.
//
// NOT part of this primitive (R7.1's own text): memory-plane consumer
// policy -- closed-before-T boundary, sibling exclusion, supersession
// exclusion (gastownhall/beads#5877). Those are layered on top by a
// consumer, not implemented here.
//
// ALL THREE LEGS SHARE THIS BODY, the same way CompareAndSetMetadataKeyInTx,
// R16's CompareAndSetVersionInTx, and R20's epoch_cas.go do: the two
// Dolt-backed stores wrap it in their own transaction, and the
// unit-of-work provider reaches it through its own leg-specific adapter.
// Each leg's own contract-test file is the translation boundary to and from
// backend/conformance's Address/Restriction vocabulary -- this file knows
// nothing about the conformance package (same package-boundary precedent as
// epoch_cas.go's EpochRestriction).
//
// removed_at / removed_reason (migration 0067, virgin and unused before this
// slice) plus removed_restriction (migration 0069, added by this slice) are
// the durable "this version row was removed" marker AsOfReadInTx reads.
// R7.1 only READS them here; a future R17 (not yet implemented on this
// branch) will be the production WRITER, via real hold/remove/erase
// primitives -- no collision, since this file never writes them outside the
// test-support seam below.
//
// STOREID IS ACCEPTED BUT NOT A FILTER, the same way CurrentEpochInTx
// accepts one: issue_versions has no store_id column, and a store's rows are
// already exactly the rows in that store's own database (one logical store
// per database, matching production reality). The parameter exists only so
// this function's signature matches AsOfReadFixture.Resolve's hook shape,
// which the conformance suite's own ad-hoc dispatch string requires (Design
// D: the suite invents storeID values to select among N genuinely isolated
// per-leg test stores; the leg fixture, not this function, does that
// isolation).

// AsOfRestriction is this file's own local answer vocabulary for R7.1's
// refusal path -- deliberately not backend/conformance.Restriction (see the
// package-boundary note above). Unlike R20's EpochRestriction (int-backed:
// R20 never persists a restriction, it recomputes GoneReorganization at read
// time from an epoch comparison), this type is STRING-backed: it is written
// directly into issue_versions.removed_restriction and read back with a
// plain cast, no separate parse/format step needed. AsOfRestrictionLive
// exists only for API symmetry with EpochRestriction's shape -- it is never
// persisted (Live is the absence of a value, removed_at IS NULL, not a
// stored one) and AsOfReadInTx never returns it.
