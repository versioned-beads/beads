// R20's epoch-transition enforcement (gastownhall/beads#5898 revision 9,
// this slice: be-x5jqd.4 / #6136) adds one brand-new table,
// epoch_minted_addresses -- see
// migrations/0069_add_epoch_minted_addresses.up.sql for the full rationale.
// Like R16's own 0069 (a different, independently-numbered migration on that
// slice's branch), this migration is a plain, unguarded
// CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS with no ALTER and no PREPARE, so it needs none
// of 0067/0068's CLI-hazard-override tests (already covered, for every
// migration including this one, by TestBundleMigrationsWithPreparedALTERAreOverriddenOrJustified
// and TestAllMigrationsSQLUsesDirectDDLForKnownCLIIncompatibilities).

// TestLatestVersionIncludesMigration0069 pins the real next free slot this
// phase claims, superseding 0068's own version of this test (LatestVersion()
// moved from 68 to 69 the moment this migration file was added). Deliberately
// a hardcoded literal for the same reason 0068's was: LatestVersion()
// drifting to 69 for the wrong reason (an unrelated migration landing first)
// should still be caught by this test failing to explain why 69 is
// epoch-minted-addresses-shaped.
